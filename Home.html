          International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) The Nobel
          Peace Prize 2017 Founded: 2007, Australia Prize motivation: “for its
          work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences
          of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to
          achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons” Prize share: 1/1
          Fighting to prevent nuclear disaster ICAN is an international
          organisation with partner organisations in more than one hundred
          countries, including Norway. Its headquarters are in Geneva. The
          organisation was founded in 2007 to mobilise people all over the world
          to convince their governments to support a ban on nuclear weapons. In
          the eyes of the initiators, the nuclear powers were not fulfilling
          their pledges of nuclear disarmament under the 1970 Treaty on the
          Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The foundation of ICAN was
          instigated by the organisation awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985,
          the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. The
          campaign was also inspired by the 1987 Peace Prize laureate, Jody
          Williams and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.
